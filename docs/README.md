## What it is[¶](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/#what-it-is)

Observability is the capability to continuously generate and discover actionable insights based on signals from the system under observation. In other words, observability allows users to understand a system’s state from its external output and take (corrective) action.

## Problem it addresses[¶](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/#problem-it-addresses)

Computer systems are measured by observing low-level signals such as CPU time, memory, disk space, and higher-level and business signals, including API response times, errors, transactions per second, etc.

The observability of a system has a significant impact on its operating and development costs. Observable systems yield meaningful, actionable data to their operators, allowing them to achieve favorable outcomes (faster incident response, increased developer productivity) and less toil and downtime.

## How it helps[¶](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/#how-it-helps)

Understanding that more information does not necessarily translate into a more observable system is pivotal. In fact, sometimes, the amount of information generated by a system can make it harder to identify valuable health signals from the noise generated by the application. Observability requires the right data at the right time for the right consumer (human or piece of software) to make the right decisions.

## What you will find here[¶](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/#what-you-will-find-here)

This site contains our best practices for observability: what do to, what *not* to do, and a collection of recipes on how to do them. Most of the content here is vendor agnostic and represents what any good observability solution will provide.

It is important that you consider observability as a *solution* though and not a *product*. Observability comes from your practices, and is integral to strong development and DevOps leadership. A well-observed application is one that places observability as a principal of operations, similar to how security must be at the forefront of how you organize a project. Attempting to “bolt-on” observability after the fact is an anti-pattern and meets with less success.

This site is organized into four categories:

1. [Best practices by solution, such as for dashboarding, application performance monitoring, or containers](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/guides/)
2. [Best practices for the use of different data types, such as for logs or traces](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/signals/logs/)
3. [Best practices for specific AWS tools (though these are largely fungible to other vendor products as well)](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/tools/cloudwatch_agent/)
4. [Curated recipes for observability with AWS](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/recipes/)

!!! Success
     This site is based on real world use cases that AWS and our customers have solved for.
    Observability is at the heart of modern application development, and a critical consideration when operating distributed systems, such as microservices, or complex applications with many external integrations. We consider it to be a leading indicator of a healthy workload, and we are pleased to share our experiences with you here!

Amazon EC2 的功能
Amazon EC2 提供以下功能：

虚拟计算环境，也称为实例

实例的预配置模板，也称为 Amazon 系统映像 (AMI)，其中包含您的服务器需要的程序包（包括操作系统和其他软件）。

实例 CPU、内存、存储和网络容量的多种配置，也称为实例类型

使用密钥对的实例的安全登录信息（AWS 存储公有密钥，您在安全位置存储私有密钥）

临时数据（停止、休眠或终止实例时会删除这些数据）的存储卷，也称为实例存储卷

使用 Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) 的数据的持久性存储卷，也称为 Amazon EBS 卷。

用于存储资源的多个物理位置，例如实例和 Amazon EBS 卷，也称为区域 和可用区

防火墙，让您可以指定协议、端口，以及能够使用安全组到达您的实例的源 IP 范围

用于动态云计算的静态 IPv4 地址，称为弹性 IP 地址

元数据，也称为标签，您可以创建元数据并分配给您的 Amazon EC2 资源

您可以创建的虚拟网络，这些网络与其余 AWS 云在逻辑上隔离，并且您可以选择连接到您自己的网络，也称为 Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)。
